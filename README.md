HomeScout - Real Estate Listing and Viewing System
- Created a platform for property trading that involves three parties of users, namely sellers, buyers, and administrators.
- The system provides buyers with a fuzzy query function and combines condition filtering based on SQL statements, helping users accurately query target listings.
- It uses the Gaode Map API to display the statistical data of housing listings by zoom level (administrative district, community, etc.), enabling users to obtain details by clicking on the housing icon on the map.
- For the home page of housing listings, it provides a small map to view the surrounding facilities (schools, hospitals, etc.), comments, popularity, and the like.
- The popularity is weighted by the Click-Through Rate (CTR), the number of surrounding facilities, and the number of comments.
